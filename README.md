# Database Project

This repository contains the **implementation part** of a university-level database project (Phase 2), focused on building a functional backend using SQL. The project involves designing tables, relationships, and implementing core database logic for a simple **messaging/reservation system**.

## 🛠 Implemented Features

- ✅ **Normalized schema** (based on ER model) up to BCNF
- 🧾 **Custom SQL queries** for data insertion, updates, and retrieval
- 📄 **Views** for message organization, user interaction, and group communications
- 🔁 **Triggers** to log important table changes (insert/update/delete)
- 🔐 **User roles and permissions** (read-only / full access)
- 🧠 **SQL functions** for:
  - Counting messages between two users
  - Getting recently active users
  - Fetching conversation history
  - Searching messages by keyword
- ⚠️ **Assertions** to preserve data integrity (e.g., unique phone numbers)
- 
## ⚙️ Tools & Environment

- SQL Engine: **PostgreSQL** (recommended) or **MySQL**
- Tested with: pgAdmin, DBeaver, MySQL Workbench
- OS: Windows / Linux

## 📌 Note

This is an academic implementation focused on applying real-world database concepts such as normalization, access control, and automation using SQL logic.
